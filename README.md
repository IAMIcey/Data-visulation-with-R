# Data-visulation-with-R
Data visitation of NY parking violation data with R (ggplot2,shiny)

## Introduction
New York City is notorious for the traffic and crazy drivers, driving in New York City is a nightmare, but
finding a parking lot is even worse, especially in Manhattan. Due to the limitation of parking space and
expensive parking garage rates, many people would risk it to park illegally on the street, some people get
away from punishment, but most people would receive a ticket. In this project, we are going to look at
parking violations in New York City, we collected the data from the five counties(New York, Richmond,
Queens, Kings, and Bronx) belonging to New York City. We want to investigate if some hidden factors are
playing an important role in the number of violations issued.
